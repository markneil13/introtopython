#Modifying string variables
#You did so well working with LLM Camp's reviews that they've asked for your help again.

#They have a variable called most_popular_course, which contains the name of their highest-ranked course. It has been provided in script.py so you can see its contents. However, there are issues with it:

#There's a typo. It should be "Introduction" rather than "Intro".
#They want to remove spaces and use underscores to make it easier to analyze.
#For consistency, they want all characters to be lowercase.
#They'd like your support in making these changes!



#Update the variable so that "Intro" now reads "Introduction".

most_popular_course = most_popular_course.replace("Intro", "Introduction")
print(most_popular_course)
